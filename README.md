# Project 6: Build a navigation app for your phone
Contact: stephen.creff@gmail.com

# Project description

## Discovering a cross-platform app development framework
You will discover programming building a phone application. A great opportunity to use native or cross-platform app development framework to build an iOS or Android app, in a language of your choice (Python, Java, …).

Given the language, you will select a development framework (techological stack), and will have to discover it (help will be provided: tutorials, ...). A common caracteristics in software project is to be faced to new framework and APIs, you will have to understand the framework and the APIs (libraries, widgets, …) avialables.

## About the application: the navigation app

A navigation map is a way to discover App programming, not an end in itself.
In your progression, think of your application in an incremental way: add features one by one, start small and grow!
Add features and sensors solicitation step by step, from trivial to rich location-based: 
- Define map (simplified, real, feature-rich), set geo-markers, calculate and draw route, …
- Define a storyboard and mock-up the Interface design
- Define and build functions using smartphone sensors: e.g. Touch screen, Geolocation service, …
Package & deploy your app on the targeted OS.

# Key points of the project:
- Follow a full system development workflow, you are building a product on a target (your phone)
- Learn to program and use dedicated APIs, that's a frequent case in software programming
- Implement routing problem, pathfinding algorithms, 
- And, have fun with your phone!

# Some frameworks to build Mobile Applications: 
A python framework: https://kivy.org/#home
A java framework: https://www.codenameone.com/
Other framework, with combination of many languages i.e., HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS and Cordova wrapper: https://ionicframework.com/
The React Native framework from Facebook (https://reactnative.dev/)
Some specific IOS, like SwiftUI (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
